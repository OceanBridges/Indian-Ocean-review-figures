## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



 
###Starting from here load ggplot, sf, r natural earth, rnaturalearthdata
  
  library("ggplot2")
  theme_set(theme_bw())
  library("sf")
  
  library("rnaturalearth")
  library("rnaturalearthdata")
  
  world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
  class(world)
  
  ## [1] "sf"  
  ## [1] "data.frame"
  

##### Set working directory
  setwd("C:/Users/subhadeep/Desktop/Review/map_rates/19th Oct 2022_Rates plot_surface and integrated")
  
  
#load your data; within seasons column mention the season to plot together
  data <- read.table("integrated rates.txt", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NaN")
  
###convert your text data to numeric data
  
  data$Rates=as.numeric(data$Rates)
  
#### this code is to remove NA from your data without touching excel or text file
  nadata=which(is.na(data$Rates))
  dim(data)
  data=data[-nadata,]
  dim(data)
####this code will search the value more than something that you mentioned and mutate in a specific value that you want
  
  for (i in 1:dim(data)[1]) {
    if(data$Rates[i] > 177.0)
      data$Rates[i] = 177.0
  }
  
####rate plotting by ggplot 
 ggplot(data = world) +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(25, 130), ylim = c(30, -60), expand = FALSE) +
   geom_point(data = data, mapping = aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, size = Rates, color=Monsoon), shape = 19) + 
   scale_color_manual( values=c("deeppink", "blue3", "deeppink", "darkorange"))+ scale_radius(range = c(1,6),limits=c(0.7,177),breaks=c(5,25,50,75, 100, 150, 177))
